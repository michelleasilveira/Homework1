    "text": "What is being a data scientist about?\nBeing a data scientist is about applying scientific methods in data analysis to\nsolve research, business and different problems, preparing and analyzing data, creating and applying models,\nand communicating insights so that others can act on them.\nIt’s like detective work, engineering, and storytelling combined.\nSome common activities include: - Wrangling and data cleaning and transformation - Building and validating models - Sharing results in clear, reproducible reports - Thinking about ethics and the impact of analysis\n\n\nMichelle Data scientists vs. statisticians\nSimilarities - Both rely on data, probability, and models. - Both value reproducibility and critical thinking.\nDifferences - Statisticians often emphasize theory, inference, and study design and usually focus on the event modeling and the relationship between the event/target and input (independent) variables, and the sampling process as well.\n- Data scientists often emphasize end‑to‑end workflows, coding, and deployment, focusing on agile models that fit product needs and challenging production models with challenger approaches.\nMy view\nI see myself as combining both: I like the theoretical rigor of statistics\nand the practical, tool‑driven mindset of data science.\n\n\nExploring a density object in R\nWe will now create a kernel density estimate of iris$Petal.Width.\nFirst, we create the object:\n\n# Step 1: Create the object\ny &lt;- density(iris$Petal.Width)\n\nNext, we look inside the object:\n\n# Step 2: Look inside the object\nclass(y)\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nstr(y)\n\nList of 8\n $ x         : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 ...\n $ y         : num [1:512] 0.00161 0.00178 0.00197 0.00217 0.00239 ...\n $ bw        : num 0.252\n $ n         : int 150\n $ old.coords: logi FALSE\n $ call      : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width)\n $ data.name : chr \"iris$Petal.Width\"\n $ has.na    : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n\nFinally, we plot the density:"
